## Issue type
I'm submitting a (check one):
<pre><code>
[ ] Bug report
[ ] Feature request
[ ] Regression (something that used to work, but stopped working in a newer version)
[ ] Support request
[ ] Documentation issue or request
</code></pre>

## Prerequisites
Befor posting, make sure you do the following (check all):
<pre><code>
[ ] Search GitHub for a similar issue or PR
[ ] If submitting a Support request, also search [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=angular2+json+schema+form) for similar issues
Note: Please cross-post all GitHub support requests to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=angular2+json+schema+form), and include a link in your GitHub issue to your Stack Overflow question. At the moment, we will respond to support requests on both GitHub and Stack Overflow (and we check GitHub more often). But eventually we expect to stop answering support issues on GitHub and refer all support questions exclusively to Stack Overflow.
[ ] If submitting a Regression, include the version numbers for both the earlier working and later broken versions
[ ] Confirm you are using the latest versions of all necessary packages (or if not, explain why not)

If that is not possible, describe the minimum step-by-step procedure necessary to reproduce the problem.

If the problem is not simple to reproduce, please link to a minimal demo of the problem in a GitHub repository or [Plnkr](https://plnkr.co) example.
