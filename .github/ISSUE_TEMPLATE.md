## Issue type
I'm submitting a (check one):
[ ] Bug report
[ ] Feature request
[ ] Regression (something that used to work, but stopped working in a newer version)
[ ] Support request
[ ] Documentation issue or request

## Prerequisites
Before posting, make sure you do the following (check all):
[ ] Confirm you are using the latest versions of all necessary packages (or if not, explain why not)
[ ] Search GitHub for a similar issue or PR
[ ] If submitting a Support request, also search [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow] for similar issues
Note: Please cross-post GitHub support requests to [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow], and include a link in your GitHub issue to your Stack Overflow question. We do currently respond to support requests on GitHub, but we eventually expect to stop, and will then refer all support questions exclusively to Stack Overflow.

## Current behavior
<!-- Describe what is currently happening. -->


## Expected behavior
<!-- Describe what you think should happen instead. -->


## IMPORTANT: How can we reproduce your problem?
<!--
In order to fix your problem, we _must_ first reproduce it.

Ideally, if you can cause the problem in the [demonstration playground][demonstration-playground], just copy the entire contents of the "Input JSON Schema and Form Layout" text area and paste it here.

If you cannot recreate the problem in the demonstration playground (for example, if it's an installation error or a conflict with another library), then describe the minimum step-by-step procedure necessary to reproduce it.

If the problem is not simple to reproduce, link to a minimal demo of the problem in a GitHub repository or [JSFiddle][jsfiddle] or [Plnkr][plnkr] example.
