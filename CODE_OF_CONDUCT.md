# Contributor Code of Conduct
## Angular JSON Schema Form

### Short / plain english version

Don't be an asshole.

As long as you make an effort to be courteous and helpful, and always behave as though everyone else is doing the same (especially in cases where someone's actions might suggest otherwise), you'll probably find people to help you, and everything else will work itself out.

If you see a single offensive message from someone else, it is often helpful to assume that person did not intend offense, and simply made a mistake in their choice of language. In that case, it may sometimes be worth politely replying—_once_—to point out why another person might find the original message offensive, and how it could be rephrased to communicate its relevant point without offense. Alternately, or of the original author continues to post additional offensive messages, please report the problem to a maintainer and do not respond to the offensive author again.

### Long / legalese version (TL;DR)

All contributors and maintainers of the Angular JSON Schema Form project are expected to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, or through any other activities.

All communication through any of this project's channels must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

Maintainers will extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, political or professional affiliation, or level of experience. We expect everyone contributing to do the same.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the maintainers reserve the right to take action, including editing or removing issues, comments, and PRs, or, in the case of extreme or repeated violators, even blocking accounts and prohibiting offenders from participating in this project.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have other concerns, please email the project lead at [dschnelldavis@gmail.com](mailto:dschnelldavis@gmail.com).
